# OpenDrive Clipboard

A public-safe AI agent prototype that helps **licensed driving instructors** turn teachable driving moments into reviewed post-drive debrief notes, student reflection prompts, lesson recommendations, language-access summaries, and audit-style demo logs.

| Field | Value |

| Organization | Street Law OpenDrive / OpenDriveEDU |
| Prepared for | Google / Devpost AI Agents Challenge planning |
| Owner | Mr. Law — Founder, Lead Instructor, and Product Lead |
| Build lane | OpenDrive AI Lab — prototype/testing lane before production use |
| Prototype boundary | Fake/demo data only; instructor-supervised; not a licensing or vehicle-control tool |

## What this is NOT

**This is not an AI driving instructor.**

- It does not communicate with students during a drive.
- It does not control or assist the vehicle.
- It does not make licensing, grading, or pass/fail decisions.
- It does not run in real-time during behind-the-wheel sessions.

The licensed human instructor remains the sole authority for behind-the-wheel instruction. This tool only generates **post-drive paperwork drafts** that the instructor reads, edits, and approves before anything reaches a student or family. Compliant with WA RCW 46.82 + WAC 308-108. See `docs/dol-edu/BEACON-IS-AND-IS-NOT.md` for the full boundary statement.

## 1. Executive Summary

OpenDrive Clipboard is a focused, hackathon-safe version of the larger OpenDriveEDU safety vision. It does not try to replace the instructor, run a full LMS, process student records, control a vehicle, or expose Beacon production concepts. It demonstrates one valuable layer: turning a **post-drive event recap** into a **reviewed debrief note** that the licensed instructor approves before delivery.

The agent receives a demo driving scenario such as late braking near a crosswalk, speed creep in a residential area, or uncertainty at a yellow light. It then organizes the moment into an **instructor-ready debrief note** with a safety summary, risk pattern, suggested lesson focus, reflection prompt, practice assignment, language-access preview, and saved demo log. **The instructor approves, edits, or rejects every output. Nothing reaches a student or family without instructor sign-off.**

---

## 2. Problem Worth Solving

Driver education has a gap between classroom knowledge and in-car behavior. A student may know a rule but still miss a pedestrian, rush a yellow light, follow too closely, freeze under pressure, or fail to verbalize what they are scanning. **Instructors** need fast, consistent ways to preserve those teachable moments and turn them into useful follow-up paperwork after the drive ends.

This problem is especially important when instruction includes young drivers, new adult drivers, international students, language-access needs, and families who need clear after-lesson summaries. The goal is not to create a bigger pile of notes. The goal is to give the licensed instructor a better post-drive debrief workflow.

## 3. Target User

| User | Need |
|---|---|
| **Driving instructor** (primary) | Quick, accurate post-drive debrief language after a teachable moment; full edit/approve/reject control |
| **Student driver** | A clear reflection prompt and a next practice focus, delivered by the instructor |
| **Family / support person** | A short, plain-language follow-up summary without private system data, delivered by the instructor |

---

## 4. Product Concept

The app is a **web-based instructor dashboard**. The instructor selects or enters a demo event, asks the agent to draft a post-drive debrief note, reviews the note, optionally generates a language-access preview, and saves the **approved** demo record.

| Feature | What it proves in the demo |
|---|---|
| Scenario Intake | A structured form captures a fake/demo drive event, location type, observed concern, and instructor notes. |
| Debrief Draft | Gemini/agent workflow classifies the safety concern and drafts a post-drive debrief note for the instructor to review. |
| Suggested Lesson Focus (instructor confirms) | The agent suggests a lesson focus such as scanning, intersections, speed control, following distance, or emotional self-control — the instructor confirms before it is saved. |
| Reflection Prompt Suggestion (instructor confirms) | The agent drafts a student-friendly reflection question and practice assignment for the instructor to confirm. |
| Language Access Preview | An instructor-reviewed bilingual support preview demonstrates future access for students and families. |
| Human Review Gate | Instructor can approve, edit, reject, or regenerate before anything is saved. **Hard gate, not optional.** |
| Demo Log | Saved workflow records prove the agent completes a real post-drive task beyond chat. |

## 5. Agent Workflow

```
Instructor enters demo event
        ↓
Agent classifies safety concern + drafts debrief note
        ↓
Agent suggests lesson focus + reflection prompt
        ↓
[ HUMAN REVIEW GATE — instructor approves / edits / rejects ]
        ↓
Approved note saved to demo log (with language-access preview if requested)
```

The Human Review Gate is a hard gate. No output reaches a student or family record without instructor sign-off.

## 6. Recommended Hackathon Stack

The prototype should stay clean and demo-focused. The strongest build is a new public repo that references OpenDriveEDU but does not merge private OpenDriveEDU, Beacon, Vault, or production student-data systems.

| Layer | Recommended choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Vue 3 + Inertia + Tailwind | Fast demo UI, clean component pages, modern Laravel workflow. |
| Backend | Laravel | Strong routing, auth-ready structure, policies, controllers, and service classes. |
| Agent | Gemini + Google Cloud Agent Builder / ADK-ready design | Shows a real agent workflow that classifies, retrieves, drafts, **waits for instructor review**, and saves. |
| Data | MongoDB or SQLite demo store; BigQuery later | MongoDB is strong for partner-track retrieval; SQLite keeps local demo simple; BigQuery fits future research logs. |
| Language access | Curated glossary + Gemini/Translation preview | Safe preview of bilingual support without claiming official translation. |
| Deployment | Hosted web demo; Google Cloud Run is a good target | Easy for judges to test; aligns with Google Cloud. |

## 7. Simple Architecture

```
Instructor Web UI
        ↓
Laravel Services (routes, policies, workflow records)
        ↓
Agent + Tool Layer (Gemini reasoning, lesson retrieval, language preview)
        ↓
[ HUMAN REVIEW GATE ]
        ↓
Reviewed Output (approved debrief note, audit-style demo log)
```

## 10. Three-Minute Demo Script

| Time | What to show |
|---|---|
| 0:00–0:25 | Problem: instructors need a fast, safer way to turn post-drive moments into reviewed debrief notes. |
| 0:25–0:55 | Enter a fake event: late braking near a crosswalk, speed pressure, or yellow-light indecision. |
| 0:55–1:35 | Run the agent: classify risk, retrieve lesson context, draft post-drive debrief note. |
| 1:35–2:10 | **Instructor review (on-screen text: "the human instructor reviews and approves before anything is saved")**: edit/approve; show the human-in-the-loop gate explicitly. |
| 2:10–2:35 | Language-access preview: show support summary and vocabulary disclaimer. |
| 2:35–3:00 | Demo log: saved record, privacy boundary, future roadmap. |

---

## 11. Submission Planning

Current planning assumption: build a public-safe demo early, then use the final days for README, license, deployment, screenshots, demo video, and Devpost form. Confirm the exact deadline and final rules from the acceptance page because public program pages can differ.

| Asset | Status target |
|---|---|
| Hosted demo URL | Working by MVP freeze. |
| Public code repository | New repo only; complete open-source license visible. |
| README + setup instructions | Clear local install, env examples, fake-data seed command. |
| Demo video | About 3 minutes; show workflow, **human review gate**, and privacy boundary. |
| Screenshots | Dashboard, event intake, debrief note review, language preview, demo log, Boundary page. |

## Safety statement

Fake data only; not a licensing, diagnostic, enforcement, or vehicle-control tool. Not an AI driving instructor. The licensed human instructor is the sole authority for behind-the-wheel instruction; this tool only drafts post-drive paperwork for the instructor to review and approve. Operates within WA RCW 46.82 + WAC 308-108.

## Source note

This brief replaces and supersedes the prior `OpenDrive_Safety_Coach_Project_Brief.txt` (deprecated 2026-04-30). Renamed and reframed to make the human-instructor authority and post-drive boundary explicit at every public surface. Treat official Devpost contest rules and deadlines as pending until confirmed after acceptance.
